Our bioinformatics activities cover different various aspects:

* ***Research*** - **in silico** experimentation, such as development of novel methods, tools and pipelines.
* ***Consultancy*** – we can provide recommendations in experimental design for e.g. RNASeq and various DNA sequencing projects.
* ***Bioinformatics Service provision*** - We are happy to provide data analysis solutions (fee for service).

# Research

The size and complexity of the wheat genome exposes some unique problems for bioinformatics. These require the development
of novel approaches for data handling and analyses.

  * Wheat genomics and transcriptomics
  * Marker development
  * Software development
  * Pipeline and algorithm development

# Service

Please contact: <a href="mailto:ute.baumann@adelaide.edu.au">ute.baumann@adelaide.edu.au</a> for further informaiton.

# Training

The group has expertise in the development and delivery of hands-on bioinformatics workshop.

# Leadership

  * The CroBiAd group is the South Australian node of the EMBL-Australia Bioinformatics Resource
    ([EMBL-ABR](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/)). Our involvement brings bioinformatics expertise from the agricultural
    field, which has significantly different requirements to the human/medical field. Our activities here aim to secure
    NCRIS funding to formally establish an Australian Bioscience Data Capability (ABDC).

# Industry and International Collaborations

  * DuPont Pioneer - A 10 years collaboration
  * [Wheat Hub](http://www.wheathub.com.au/)
  * Biogemma
  * International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium ([IWGSC](https://www.wheatgenome.org/))
  * Wheat Information System Expert Working group
