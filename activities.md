Bioinformatics work is often considered to have two major apsects:

  * ***Research*** - The **in silico** experimentation, novel method, tools and pipeline development. All requiring significant
    intellectual input.
  * ***Service*** - The "push button" bioinformatics. That is, the routine, turn-key solutions which requires limited intellectual
    input in order to perform the actions.

The CroBiAd group has activities in both these areas.

# Research

The size and complexity of wheat genomics exposes some unique problems for bioinformatics. These require the development
of novel approaches for data handling and analyses.

  * Wheat genomics and transcriptomics
  * Marker development
  * Software development
  * Pipeline and algorithm development

# Service

# Training

The group has expertise in the development and delivery of hands-on bioinformatics workshop.
