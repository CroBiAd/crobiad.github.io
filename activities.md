Bioinformatics work is often considered to have two major apsects:

  * ***Research*** - The **in silico** experimentation, novel method, tools and pipeline development. All requiring significant
    intellectual input.
  * ***Service*** - The "push button" bioinformatics. That is, the routine, turn-key solutions which requires limited intellectual
    input in order to perform the actions.

The CroBiAd group has activities in both these areas.

# Research

The size and complexity of wheat genomics exposes some unique problems for bioinformatics. These require the development
of novel approaches for data handling and analyses.

  * Wheat genomics and transcriptomics
  * Marker development
  * Software development
  * Pipeline and algorithm development

# Service

# Training

The group has expertise in the development and delivery of hands-on bioinformatics workshop.

# Leadership

  * The CroBiAd group is the South Australian node of the EMBL-Australia Bioinformatics Resource
    ([EMBL-ABR](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/)). Our involvement brings bioinformatics expertise from the agricultural
    field, which has significantly different requirements to the human/medical field. Our activities here aim to secure
    NCRIS funding to formally establish an Australian Bioscience Data Capability (ABDC).

# Industry and International Collaborations

  * DuPont Pioneer - A 10 year collaboration involving ...
  * [Wheat Hub](http://www.wheathub.com.au/)
  * Biogemma
  * International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium ([IWGSC](https://www.wheatgenome.org/))
