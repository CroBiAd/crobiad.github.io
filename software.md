The group develops a wide range of software, predominantly aimed at biology end-users in order to
democratize crop genomic resources.

Because of the nature of our funding and research, much of our code is developed
internally and maintained using git repositories on a [local GitLab](/internal/code) install.
As projects approach publication, these resources are moved to our publically accessible
[GitHub account](https://github.com/CroBiAd).
